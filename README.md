# AlgorithmVisualizer
A program for visualizing simple sorting algorithms

Main method in VisAlgs.java opens a window displaying an unsorted array of integers,
with lengths representing the values of each integer in the array.
The method will then sort the array using one of the three sorting algorithms, 
(Bubble, Selection, Insertion).  

I would like to add a menu where the user can select which sorting algorithm they would like to see be used
to sort using JButtons.

Stats to compare the sorting speeds would be a later addition.
