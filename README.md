# AlgorithmVisualizer
A program for visualizing simple sorting algorithms

Main method in VisAlgs.java opens a window displaying an unsorted array of integers,
with lengths representing the values of each integer in the array.
The method will then sort the array using one of the three sorting algorithms, 
(Bubble, Selection, Insertion).  

The goal is to have the program let the user decide which algorithm they would like to see 
be used to sort the array by clicking the respective button.
