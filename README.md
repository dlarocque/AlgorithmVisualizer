# AlgorithmVisualizer

A program for visualizing sorting algorithms.

## Set up

Clone the project onto your local machine and run it through your preferred IDE or through the command line.

## How to use 

Once the app is running, a frame will appear, containing buttons with the names of different sorting algorithms.

To see one of the sorting algorithms listed by the buttons, simply click on the one you wish to see be used to sort an unsorted array.

Once the array is sorted after several seconds, a pop up pane will appear to inform you that the sorting is complete, press 'OK' to return back to the menu.

## Future updates

- Fix problem where if 'OK' button is not pressed on the pop up pane, the user cannot return to the menu without restarting the program by adding a message on the frame telling the user to press a key to return to the menu.

- Add several more sorting algorithms

- Add stats on the top of the screen, or at the end of the sorting such as index swaps, time elapsed.

- Replace buttons with custom images.

- Make the app runnable through a .jar file
