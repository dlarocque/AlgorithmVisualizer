# AlgorithmVisualizer

A program for visualizing sorting algorithms.

## Set up

Clone the project onto your local machine and run it through your preferred IDE or through the command line.

## How to use 

Once the app is running, a frame will appear, containing buttons with the names of different sorting algorithms.

To see one of the sorting algorithms listed by the buttons, simply click on the one you wish to see be used to sort an unsorted array.

Once the array is sorted after several seconds, a pop up pane will appear to inform you that the sorting is complete, press 'OK' to return back to the menu.

## Future updates

- Add Merge sort and Quick sort.

- Add stats on the top of the screen, or at the end of the sorting such as index swaps, time elapsed.

- Make the app runnable through a .jar file
